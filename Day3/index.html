<!-- HW:- why absolute path does not work here, Think and give the reason? -->

<!--
📌 NOTE: Why absolute path doesn't work in HTML

Relative Path (✅ works):
../Day2/img1.png
✔ Refers to file location relative to the current HTML file.
✔ Browser can access it because it's within the project folder.

Absolute Path (❌ doesn't work):
C:\Users\snghm\OneDrive\Desktop\Web Dev NEXUS\HTML\Day2\img1.png
✖ This is a Windows file system path.
✖ Browsers block local absolute paths for security reasons.
✖ Not a valid URL – browser can't locate or access this file.

✅ Always use relative paths or proper web URLs in HTML for images and file links.
